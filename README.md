### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
I'm <b>Thomas Mastantuono</b> and I'm a 4th year student at the University of Waterloo studying Engineering. I have a passion for coding, specifically AI. I also love to develop games and have posted some here on my Github. I always have at least one game in development at all times so feel free to ask me about it!
